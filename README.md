RepCATV-Custom-Clock-3.1
========================

This version based on HTML and Javascript also illustrates the date and time running via setInterval() function.

When development started on July 2, 2014, Custom Clock 3.1 was known as 'The Clock 3.1', the third version that succeeded both The Clock 2.7 and The Clock 2014

However, RepCATV changed this name to 'Custom Clock 2014' before July 7, 2014.
